# Chaos

[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/kai-niemi/chaos/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/kai-niemi/chaos/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

A small JDBC application for comparing the semantics of read-committed (RC) 
and serializable (1SR) isolation levels in CockroachDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL 
and Oracle.

Specifically by observing application impact around:

- Number of retries and time spent retrying: 
  - Frequency of concurrency errors and transient SQL exceptions (code 40001 or 40P01)
- Performance impact by:
  - Weaker vs stronger isolation
  - Pessimistic locking using `FOR UPDATE` or `FOR SHARE`
  - Optimistic locking using compare-and-set (CAS)
- Correct execution while exposed to:
  - P4 lost update
  - A5B write skew 
  - A5A read skew

# How it works

The application is intentionally designed to cause pathological workload contention 
by concurrently updating an overlapping set of keys in a conflicting order and using
aggregate functions in queries (thus more subject to skewed observations). 

The purpose is to observe the application impact on correctness and performance while
running the workloads and playing around with isolation levels and locking strategy,
as outlined above.

The workloads are simple and centered around a single `account` table simulating 
bank accounts (see more below). In the end of each run, certain consistency checks
are performed to verify that the accounts remain in a correct state and not in 
breaching of any invariants. 

Inconsistent outcomes will occur when runnning in weaker isolation levels than 1SR 
and not using any locking strategy. That is the general tradeoff with weaker isolation, 
that you risk incorrect outcomes unless taking certain measures application-side 
like using optimistic or pessmistic locking.

# Sample Workloads

A description of the highly contented workloads named by the anomalies they are subject to.

## Lost Update (P4)

Examples:
    
    java -jar target/chaos.jar --isolation rc lost_update
    java -jar target/chaos.jar --url "jdbc:postgresql://192.168.1.2:5432/chaos" --profile psql lost_update 

This workload concurrently executes the following statements (at minimum 4) using 
explicit transactions and N threads:

    BEGIN; 
    SELECT balance from account where id=1;
    SELECT balance from account where id=2;
    UPDATE account set balance=? where id = 1; -- balace @1 + 5
    UPDATE account set balance=? where id = 2; -- balance @2 - 5
    COMMIT;

The interleaving hopefully results in a conflicting order of operations 
causing the database to rollback transactions with a transient, retryable errors 
(40001 code) when running under 1SR. When running under RC it results in lost updates
(as expected) unless a locking strategy is applied (see --locking).

This workload is unsafe in RC unless using optimistic "locks" through a CAS operation
(version increments) or by using pessimistic `SELECT .. FOR UPDATE/SHARE` locks at read time.

Ex:

    BEGIN; --T1 
    BEGIN; --T2 
    SELECT balance from account where id=1; --T1
    SELECT balance from account where id=1; --T2
    SELECT balance from account where id=2; --T1
    UPDATE account set balance=? where id = 1; -- T1
    SELECT balance from account where id=2; --T2
    UPDATE account set balance=? where id = 2; -- T1
    COMMIT; --T1
    UPDATE account set balance=? where id = 1; -- T2
    UPDATE account set balance=? where id = 2; -- T2
    COMMIT; --T2

The level of contention can be adjusted by increasing the number of account tuples,
number of concurrent executors or by reducing the selection of account IDs involved 
in the interleaving. This allows for creating a high number of accounts spanning 
many ranges while still being able to cause contention.

## Write Skew (A5b)

Examples:

    java -jar target/chaos.jar --isolation rc --selection 20 write_skew
    java -jar target/chaos.jar --url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/chaos" --profile psql --isolation rc write_skew 

In this workload, accounts are organized in tuples where the same surrogate id is shared by a 
checking and credit account. The composite primary key is `id,type`. The business rule (invariant) 
is that the account balances can be negative or positive as long as the sum of both accounts is be >= 0.

| id | type     | balance |
|----|----------|---------|
| 1  | checking | -5.00   |
| 1  | credit   | 10.00   |
| Î£  | -        | +5.00   | 

Write skew can happen if `T1` and `T2` reads the total balance (which is >0 ) and 
independently writes a new balance to different rows.

Preset:

    insert into account (id, type, balance) values(1, 'checking', -5.00);
    insert into account (id, type, balance) values(1, 'credit', 10.00);

Assume transaction `T1` and `T2`:

| T1                                                                                 | T2                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| begin;                                                                             | begin;                                                                              |
| set transaction isolation level read committed;                                    | set transaction isolation level read committed;                                     |
|                                                                                    | select sum(balance) from account where id=1; -- 5.00                                |
| select sum(balance) from account where id=1; -- 5.00                               |                                                                                     |
| update account set balance=balance-5 where id=1 and type='credit';  -- ok sum is 0 |                                                                                     | 
|                                                                                    | update account set balance=balance-5 where id=1 and type='checking'; -- ok sum is 0 | 
| commit; --ok                                                                       |                                                                                     | 
|                                                                                    | commit; -- ok (not allowed in 1SR)                                                  | 

Both transactions are correct in isolation but when put together the total sum is `-5.00` (rule violation) 
since they were both allowed to commit. This subtle anomaly is called write skew, which is prevented 
in 1SR but allowed in RC.

In summary, this workload concurrently executes the following statements (using pseudo-code):

    BEGIN; 
    SELECT sum(balance) total from account where id=<random from selection>; -- expect 2 rows
    if (total - random_amount > 0) -- app rule check
        (either)
            UPDATE account set balance=balance-? where id = 1 and type='checking'; 
        (or)
            UPDATE account set balance=balance-? where id = 2 and type='credit'; 
    endif
    COMMIT;

This workload is therefore unsafe in RC unless using optimistic "locking" through a CAS operation
(version increments). Notice that pessimistic locks can't be used due to the 
aggregate `sum` function.

**Hint:** To have a greater chance to observe anomalies in RC, decrease the `--selection` and/or
increase `--iterations` with 10x.

## Read Skew (A5a)

Examples:

    java -jar target/chaos.jar --isolation rc --selection 20 read_skew
    java -jar target/chaos.jar --url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/chaos" --profile psql --isolation rc read_skew 

This workload is similar to write skew where the account balances are read in separate statements 
and the sum is expected to remain constant. Under RC without locks, it's allowed to read values 
committed by other concurrent transactions and thereby observe deviations. Under 1SR, this is
prevented and results in a transient rollback error.
